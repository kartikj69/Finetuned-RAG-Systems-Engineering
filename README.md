# Finetuned-RAG-Systems-Engineering
This project focuses on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, a cutting-edge paradigm that combines retrieval-based and generation-based models to:

Retrieve relevant information from a large corpus.
Generate coherent, domain-specific responses.
Domain and Subdomains
The system will target the following domains and subdomains:

ros2: Robotics middleware subdomain.
nav2: Navigation subdomain.
movit2: Motion planning subdomain.
gazebo: Simulation subdomain.
